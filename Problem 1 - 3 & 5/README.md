Problem 1
=========

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. > The sum of these multiples is 23.
> 
> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

For this problem, I solved it first in [PHP](https://github.com/mgatto/Project-Euler-Problems/tree/master/Problem%201%20-%203%20%26%205/PHP), then ported the best (most efficient) solution to Perl and Python.
